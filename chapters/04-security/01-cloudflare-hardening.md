# Security Hardening with Cloudflare

## Overview

Security is a critical aspect of any WordPress installation. Implementing Cloudflare's security features drastically reduced these attacks and improved overall performance.

## Cloudflare WAF Setup

### Basic WAF Configuration

Cloudflare Web Application Firewall (WAF) provides protection against common attacks while reducing server load.

1. **Sign up for Cloudflare** and add your domain
2. **Update nameservers** to point to Cloudflare
3. **Enable WAF** in the Security section of Cloudflare dashboard

### WordPress-Specific WAF Rules

Based on the Reddit case study, focus on these critical endpoints:

```
http.request.uri.path eq "/wp-login.php" or http.request.uri.path eq "/xmlrpc.php" or http.request.uri.path eq "/custom-login-path"
```

Where `/custom-login-path` is your custom login URL if you've changed it.

### Challenge Types

Choose appropriate challenge methods:

| Challenge Type | Description | Best For |
|----------------|-------------|----------|
| **JS Challenge** | Requires JavaScript execution | General protection, less intrusive |
| **Managed Challenge** | Smart detection system | Best option for WP login areas |
| **CAPTCHA** | Human verification | Highest security but more friction |

> **Real-world impact**: In the Reddit case study, adding Managed Challenge for `/wp-login.php`, `/xmlrpc.php`, and a custom login path significantly reduced brute force attacks.

## WordPress-Specific Protections

### Login Page Protection

Configure Cloudflare to protect your login page with Managed Challenge:

1. Go to **Security** > **WAF** > **Custom Rules**
2. Create a new rule:
   - Name: `WordPress Login Protection`
   - Expression: `http.request.uri.path eq "/wp-login.php"`
   - Action: `Managed Challenge`

### XMLRPC Protection

XMLRPC is a common attack vector but may be needed for some functionality:

1. If you don't use XMLRPC:
   - Expression: `http.request.uri.path eq "/xmlrpc.php"`
   - Action: `Block`

2. If you need XMLRPC for Jetpack or other services:
   - Expression: `http.request.uri.path eq "/xmlrpc.php"`
   - Action: `Managed Challenge`

### Custom Login URL Protection

If you've changed your login URL with a security plugin:

1. Create a rule with your custom path:
   - Expression: `http.request.uri.path eq "/your-custom-login"`
   - Action: `Managed Challenge`

## Rate Limiting

Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse:

1. Go to **Security** > **WAF** > **Rate limiting rules**
2. Create rules for sensitive endpoints:

```
# Login attempt rate limiting
(http.request.uri.path eq "/wp-login.php") and (http.request.method eq "POST")
- Threshold: 5 requests per minute
- Action: Block

# API and admin rate limiting
(http.request.uri.path contains "/wp-json/") or (http.request.uri.path contains "/wp-admin/")
- Threshold: 60 requests per minute
- Action: Managed Challenge
```

## WordPress + Cloudflare Integration

For optimal protection, integrate WordPress with Cloudflare:

1. Install the official Cloudflare plugin or Cloudflare APO plugin
2. Configure it with your Cloudflare Global API Key
3. Enable Automatic Platform Optimization (APO) for improved performance

## Advanced Cloudflare Configurations

### Bot Management

For sites experiencing heavy bot traffic:

1. Enable **Bot Fight Mode** in Security settings
2. Consider upgrading to **Bot Management** for more granular control

### Page Rules

Create page rules to optimize WordPress admin areas:

```
# Bypass cache for admin
URL: example.com/wp-admin*
Settings:
- Cache Level: Bypass

# High security for login
URL: example.com/wp-login.php*
Settings:
- Security Level: High
- Browser Integrity Check: On
```

## Real-World Implementation

### Step 1: Analyze Attack Patterns

Before implementing solutions, analyze your server logs to identify attack patterns:

```bash
# Check for login attempts
grep "POST /wp-login.php" /var/log/nginx/access.log | wc -l

# Check for XMLRPC attacks
grep "POST /xmlrpc.php" /var/log/nginx/access.log | wc -l
```

### Step 2: Implement Custom Rules

Create specific rules based on attack patterns:

1. Login protection with managed challenge
2. XMLRPC protection (block or challenge)
3. Rate limits for POST requests to sensitive endpoints

### Step 3: Monitor and Adjust

After implementing Cloudflare protection:

1. Monitor attack attempts in Cloudflare dashboard
2. Track server load to confirm improvement
3. Adjust WAF rules based on observations

### Step 4: Integrate with WordPress Security

Complement Cloudflare with WordPress security plugins:

- Solid Security (formerly iThemes Security, used in the case study)
- Wordfence
- Sucuri

## Case Study Results

In the Reddit case study, implementing these Cloudflare protections led to:

1. Significant reduction in server load (from 515% â†’ 117%)
2. Elimination of lockout notifications from security plugins
3. Improved backend responsiveness
4. Better PageSpeed scores
