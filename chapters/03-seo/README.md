# WordPress SEO Optimization

## Overview

SEO for WordPress involves technical configuration, content strategy, and performance optimization working together. This chapter focuses on the technical side - what developers and site administrators can control to help search engines discover, crawl, and index content effectively.

> **Key principle**: Technical SEO removes obstacles. It doesn't make bad content rank, but it ensures good content can be found. A technically perfect site with poor content won't rank, but great content on a technically broken site won't either.
