## Theme vs Plugin Territory: A Pragmatic Approach

While WordPress best practices suggest separating functionality (plugins) from presentation (themes), experienced developers sometimes take a more nuanced approach for custom projects:

### When to Break the Rules

For client-specific sites with custom themes that won't be changed:
1. **Single Repository Management** - Keeping all code in one place (the theme) simplifies maintenance and version control
2. **Simplified Deployment** - One codebase to deploy means fewer moving parts to manage
3. **Contextual Organization** - Custom post types and taxonomies often have theme-specific presentation needs

### When to Follow Best Practices

Always maintain separation when:
1. Building distributable themes or plugins
2. Working on sites that may change themes in the future
3. Creating functionality that might be reused across multiple sites

### Balanced Approach

Consider a hybrid model:
- Put truly site-specific code in the theme
- Extract potentially reusable functionality into plugins
- Document your organization decisions for future developers
