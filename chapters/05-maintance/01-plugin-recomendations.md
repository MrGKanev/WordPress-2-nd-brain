| **Autoptimize** | CSS/JS optimization | Good free option for code optimization |

## SEO Plugins

## Security

## Plugins to Avoid

According to performance experts, these plugins should be avoided when possible:

1. **Heavy security plugins** - Consider server-level security instead
2. **Bloated all-in-one plugins** - Choose focused, single-purpose alternatives. Most if not 99% of the features are not needed

## Implementation Strategy

For optimal WordPress performance, follow this plugin strategy:

1. **Start with essentials only** - Add plugins only when absolutely necessary
2. **Test performance impact** - Measure before and after adding each plugin
3. **Regularly audit plugins** - Remove unused or redundant functionality
4. **Consider coding custom solutions** - For simple needs, avoid plugins entirely

> **Expert insight**: "It's all about the plugins themselves. We all agree that fewer plugins are better, because that means less work for WordPress to do on each page processing. But a plugin can be 2 lines of code, or a huge monster like WooCommerce. Or it can also be 2 lines of code that are anything but efficient. So it's not about the quantity, but the quality."
