## XML Sitemaps and Structured Data

### WordPress XML Sitemaps

Since WordPress 5.5, a basic XML sitemap is included by default. However, for more advanced features:

1. **Default WordPress sitemaps** - Automatically generated at `https://example.com/wp-sitemap.xml`
2. **Enhanced sitemaps via plugins** - Yoast SEO, Rank Math, or other SEO plugins offer more customization options
3. **Custom implementation** - For specific site architectures, custom sitemaps may be necessary

### Implementing Structured Data

Structured data helps search engines understand your content context:

1. **Schema markup** - Adding appropriate schema.org types based on content
2. **Rich results eligibility** - Enhancing search visibility with rich snippets
3. **Integration methods** - Via theme, plugins, or custom code

### Testing and Validation

Always validate your implementation:

1. **Google Search Console** - Review index coverage and enhancement reports
2. **Rich Results Test** - Verify structured data implementation
3. **XML Sitemap validation** - Confirm proper formatting and inclusion of all relevant URLs

## Performance Optimization for SEO

### Core Web Vitals

Google now uses page experience signals (Core Web Vitals) as ranking factors:

1. **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)** - Loading performance
2. **First Input Delay (FID)** - Interactivity
3. **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)** - Visual stability

### WordPress-Specific Optimization Techniques

Several WordPress-specific optimizations can improve performance:

1. **Image optimization** - Proper sizing, formats (WebP), and lazy loading
2. **Cache implementation** - Server-level, plugin-based, or CDN caching
3. **Database optimization** - Regular cleanup of post revisions, transients, etc.
4. **JavaScript and CSS handling** - Minification, combination, and async loading
5. **Server response time** - Optimizing TTFB through proper hosting and configuration

### Monitoring Tools

Regular monitoring is essential for maintaining performance:

1. **Google PageSpeed Insights** - For overall performance scores
2. **Search Console** - For Core Web Vitals and usability issues
3. **GTmetrix and WebPageTest** - For detailed performance analysis
4. **Browser DevTools** - For real-time debugging and optimization
