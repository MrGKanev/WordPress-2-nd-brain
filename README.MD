# WordPress Second Brain

A personal knowledge repository containing everything I've learned about WordPress development, organized as a searchable reference book.

WARNING: This is a work in progress. Content may be incomplete or unverified. The book/2-nd brain was started in 2017 and some content may be outdated. It's being actively updated.

## Guidelines

**Test before you deploy.** The code and configurations in this book are meant for learning and reference. Always test on a staging environment before applying changes to production sites. We can't be responsible for broken sites - but we can help you avoid that by encouraging safe practices.

**Attribution matters.** When content, insights, or code examples come from external sources, we do our best to credit the original authors. If you notice something that should be attributed, please open an issue.

**Context is everything.** What works for one WordPress site may not work for another. Server configurations, plugin combinations, and traffic patterns all affect outcomes. Treat recommendations as starting points, not universal truths.

**Outdated doesn't mean wrong.** Some content dates back to 2017. While WordPress evolves, many fundamentals remain valid. We mark known outdated sections, but always check version compatibility for code examples.

**Contributions welcome.** Found an error? Have a better approach? Know something we don't? Pull requests and issues are appreciated. This is a living document.
